# Heart Rate Monitor Project

This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for a low-cost Heart Rate Monitor system, developed as my final project for EmbarcaTech. Designed for health monitoring and educational purposes, the project integrates sensor data processing, noise filtering, and real-time heart rate calculation.

## Overview
The Heart Rate Monitor system is a low-cost solution for capturing physiological signals, processing data in real-time, and calculating heart rate (BPM). It uses alternative sensors to avoid reliance on commercial modules like the MAX30102, making it accessible for educational and health monitoring purposes. The system includes noise filtering, peak detection algorithms, and supports data display via LCD/LED or Bluetooth transmission.

---

## Features
- Real-time heart rate monitoring.
- Low-cost sensor integration.
- Noise filtering and peak detection algorithms.
- Data display via LCD/LED or Bluetooth transmission.
- Open-source and customizable for educational use.

---

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32).
- Heart rate sensor (e.g., photoplethysmography sensor).
- Display (optional, e.g., LCD or LED).
- Bluetooth module (optional, for wireless data transmission).
- Jumper wires and breadboard.

---

## Software Requirements
- VSCode and C/C++ Extensions.
- Libraries (e.g., for sensor communication, filtering, and Bluetooth).
- Serial monitor or terminal for debugging.

---

## Usage
1. Connect the heart rate sensor and other components to the microcontroller.
2. Power up the system.
3. Monitor the heart rate data on the display or via Bluetooth.
4. Use the serial monitor for debugging and real-time data visualization.
